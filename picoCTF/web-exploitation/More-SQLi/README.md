# PicoCTF [More SQLi](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/358)
### Initial impression:
Presented with a login page, styled with the bootstrap css front end.

Upon entering test data, we are shown the backend SQL statement that is incurred when the content of the fields are posted.

Given this information, if vulnerable SQL injection, finding it should be easy.

### Foothold:
Because the Password field is called first in the SQL query, I tested that field first.
A simple ```' or 1=1;``` string allows us to login regardless of the value in the username field. This is known as an always true SQL injection. It works because the SQL server evaluates the statement like this:
```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' or 1=1;' AND username = 'test'
```
It will log into the first id from users that has a password in it's password value.

### Findings:
After leveraging the SQL injection vulnerability to login to the service, we land on a page that allows us to search a table of offices by city:

## CTF-Walkthrough
#### A personal collection of capture the flag write-ups

My project is to show my solution and thought process.

Capture the flag is a game format where players solve cybersecurity challenges in the hunt for a specific string called a flag. The flag is hidden behind layers of puzzles that aim to teach cybersecurity attack and defense methodology.

These challenges can be quite difficult. It is thus useful for players to document their methodology in order to learn from each other and grow more efficient.

I hope you find something useful here :)
